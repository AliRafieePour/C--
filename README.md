# C--

This is the final project for the course "Compiler Design". We are building a variation of C programming language (C--) from scratch using flex/bison.
In the first phase, I have analysed the users code, lexically. I have tried to cover most of the errors on this level and some minor ones from the next stage (Syntax analysis).
