# C--


This is the final project for the course "Compiler Design". We are building a variation of C programming language (C--) from scratch using flex/bison.
# Phase 1
In the first phase, I have analysed the users code, lexically. I have tried to cover most of the errors on this level and some minor ones from the next stage (Syntax analysis).
# Phase 2
In the second phase, I have designed a grammar from scratch for the C-- Language, modified it and prioritised various rules in order to have no ambiguities or conflicts while parsing. Like before, in this phase also I implemented some semantic sections for the requirements the courses imposed.
